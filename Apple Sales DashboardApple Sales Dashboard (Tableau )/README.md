#  Apple Sales Dashboard |Tableau 

## 📌 Project Overview

Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze **Apple product sales performance (2020–2024)** and **warranty/claims insights** using a relational data model. The dashboard helps stakeholders track revenue, sales volume, top-performing categories, and after-sales claim trends.

## 📊 Key Highlights

* **Total Revenue:** $6.17B
* **Total Units Sold:** 5.72M
* **Total Orders:** 1.04M
* **Claim Rate:** 2.88%
* Identified **top revenue-generating categories**, **top cities by sales**, and **active vs expired warranties** distribution.

## 🗂 Dataset Used (5 CSV files)

* `sales.csv` (1M+ transactions)
* `products.csv` (product master & pricing)
* `category.csv` (product category lookup)
* `stores.csv` (store location details)
* `warranty.csv` (claim & repair records)

## 🔗 Data Modeling

Created a **star schema using Tableau Relationships**:

* Sales linked to Products & Stores
* Products linked to Category
* Warranty linked to Products

This ensures accurate aggregations and avoids double counting.
